# Abstract
As one of the most active research hotspots in hyperspectral remote sensing, anomaly detection is widely used due to the fact that it takes effect without any priori information about the target or the background. Most of the traditional model-driven methods fail to reveal features of data with diversity due to fixed analytical modes. A variety of data-driven methods encounter difficulties in practical applications due to their costly computational complexity. In this paper, an innovative combination of point-set topology and information entropy theories is utilized to analyze mathematical-statistical properties of hyperspectral images (HSIs), thus eliminating the limitations caused by the data-model discrepancy. Specifically, the original HSI data are mapped into topological spaces in a specific form to enable ordered arrangements, in preparation for revealing data features. In particular, information entropy estimation is introduced for the first time in the adoption of point-set topology to adequately unravel the data arrangements in topological spaces, whereby the land cover information is efficiently extracted for detection. Accordingly, an interesting approach of information entropy estimation based on point-set topology (IEEPST) is proposed to resolve anomaly detection from a brand new perspective, pursuing prominent detection accuracy while ensuring computational efficiency. Experimental results on benchmark HSI data sets demonstrate that IEEPST achieves detection performance with high probabilities of detection and low false alarm rates at an inexpensive computational cost. The proposed IEEPST is highly competitive with other sophisticated and state-of-the-art methods.

# Data Set
AVIRIS-WTC: The data set was acquired on September 16, 2001 by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory using the AVIRIS to image the World Trade Center (WTC) in New York. The experimental image preserves 224 spectral channels spanning the wavelength range of 370-2510 nm. This scene contains 200×200 pixels, of which the anomalies to be detected are fire sources, occupying 83 pixels in a total of 10 locations.
